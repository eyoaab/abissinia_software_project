The technologies and tools I used while developing this project are

- **Flutter**: A powerful UI toolkit that enables the development of natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms using a single codebase. Flutter provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets and a fast development experience with its hot-reload feature.
- **Dart**:The programming language that powers Flutter applications. Dart is optimized for building fast, scalable apps across multiple platforms and provides strong typing, async support, and modern syntax.
- **BLoC (Business Logic Component)**: A design pattern and state management solution that helps keep the business logic of an application separate from its presentation layer. By using BLoC, the app maintains a clean architecture, making the code more testable, scalable, and easier to maintain
- **FIGMA**: A collaborative design tool used to create the app's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) before implementation. Figma helps visualize the appâ€™s layout and interactions, ensuring consistency and improving the overall design workflow.
